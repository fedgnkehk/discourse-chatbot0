Choose 'none' for no reranking, 'group_promotion' to promote Posts from certain Groups, 'tag_promotion' to promote Posts within Topics with certain Tags, or 'both' to promote Posts from certain Groups and with certain Tags"

        calculator:
          description: |
            Useful for getting the result of a math expression.  It is a general purpose calculator.  It works with Ruby expressions.

            You can retrieve the current date from it too and using the core Ruby Time method to calculate dates.

            The input to this tool should be a valid mathematical expression that could be executed by the base Ruby programming language with no extensions.

            Be certain to prefix any functions with 'Math.'

            Usage:
              Action Input: 1 + 1
              Action Input: 3 * 2 / 4
              Action Input: 9 - 7
              Action Input: Time.now - 2 * 24 * 60 * 60
              Action Input: Math.cbrt(13) + Math.cbrt(12)
              Action Input: Math.sqrt(8)
              Action Input: (4.1 + 2.3) / (2.0 - 5.6) * 3
